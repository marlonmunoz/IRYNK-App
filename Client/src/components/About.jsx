                        The mission, is to help new or first time parents choose a toy according to the baby's age
                        and development stage. I believe that toys are essential not only for their entertainment, but for 
                        the development of their beautilful brain. Empowering every parent with knowledege in their baby's 
                        early stages of life, could make a tremendous impact in their cognitive development in their future ahead.
